# Web Processing - Standardized Analyses for Cable Route Planing

Finding Cable Routes with the Least Coast Path Algorithmus (Dijkstra's Algorithm on Raster)
on a web processing service (WPS).

The cost rasters are calculated for with `rules2weight.py` [Documentation](/code/documentation_cost_raster_generation.md).

WPS Shall be implemented with PyWPS.
